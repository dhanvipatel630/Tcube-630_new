<b>Khandvi - The Delectable Gujarati Naashta</b>Thin layers of gram flour cooked with buttermilk and rolled up in mushy goodness, seasoned with sautéed sesame seeds and a few other spices, that's khandvi for you. The simple but aromatic garnishing of curry leaves, coriander, sautéed cumin, mustard and coconut makes it simply irresistible.  Also called 'suralichya wadya' in Maharashtra, it is a popular snack among Gujaratis and Maharashtrians alike. Although loved by all, no one can deny that this dish is a little tricky to cook, especially getting the consistency of the batter right. Light on the stomach and pleasing on the tongue, khandvi can be a perfect breakfast item or a delectable evening snack.

Traditionally prepared over charcoal or in a pressure cooker, handvo is essentially a savoury cake. To prepare handvo, a batter of lentils and rice is prepared and fermented overnight, and then baked. They are sometimes also pan-fried to make them crispy and golden, and the sesame seed seasoning makes them just irresistible! These nutritious pan-fried or baked lentil cakes are a very popular one-dish meal in Gujarati households. Like most other Gujarati snacks, they are best enjoyed with tangy green chutney and a hot cuppa.
