2]Literature Survey –  
A literature survey plays a crucial role in 
understanding the background, existing 
technologies, and previous research 
related to a project. It helps in identifying 
current trends, methodologies, tools, and 
limitations of existing systems. For the 
TCUBE project, an extensive study of 
available literature was carried out to 
analyze similar systems and approaches, 
and to identify research gaps that the 
proposed system aims to overcome.

Problem Statement, Justify your 
project title Tourists visiting new 
regions often face multiple challenges 
while planning and experiencing their 
journeys. They need to use separate 
applications for exploring tourist 
attractions, finding local food, and 
accessing medical facilities. This 
fragmented approach results in 
inconvenience, time consumption, and 
lack of emergency preparedness.

enhance access to essential information 
related to tourism, regional cuisine, and 
healthcare services across various Indian 
states. By integrating these three 
domains into a single system, Tcube 
eliminates the need for users to browse 
multiple websites and instead provides 
quick, organized, and visually supported 
information in one place.
