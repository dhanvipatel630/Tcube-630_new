Abstract:
 Tourism is a vital sector that promotes cultural exchange, economic growth, and regional development.
 However, travellers often face difficulties in finding authentic local experiences and accessing emergency healthcare facilities in unfamiliar regions. 
 Existing solutions are fragmented across different applications such as travel booking platforms, food discovery apps, and healthcare directories, which leads to inconvenience and time loss. 
 To address this challenge, we propose T-Cube (Travel, Taste, and Treatment), a unified digital platform that integrates three essential aspects of travel: tourism, food, and healthcare. 
 The systemâ€™s home interface displays all states of India, enabling users to explore region-specific information. 
 Upon selecting a state, users can access the Travel module (tourist destinations with images and details), the Taste module (famous dishes with restaurant suggestions), and the Treatment module (hospitals and medical facilities).
 The backend is powered by location-based services, curated datasets, and APIs, while the frontend provides an intuitive interface for smooth navigation. Recommendation algorithms and clustering techniques may be applied to enhance personalization.
 By integrating convenience, safety, and cultural richness into one platform, T-Cube enhances the overall travel experience, making tourism smarter, safer, and more enjoyable.
